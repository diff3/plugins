20110228 - Revision 24733

Changes

      □ Incorporated bug fixes from generic code
      □ The usage argument now also reports product version information
      □ Added Changes.txt to the archive distributed for this product, so that
        users would have a list of changes made to parts of code shared with
        other products
      □ Stopped requiring that /etc/fstab not be empty, so that program will
        run on certain VMs

20110118 - Revision 24118

Changes

      □ Incorporated bug fixes from generic code
      □ Added SSL support, requiring load-time resolution of libssl and
        libcrypto

20101206 - Revision 23418

Changes

      □ Fixed bug in web UI causing failure to run on Internet Explorer

20101111 - Revision 23090

Changes

      □ Enhanced speculative fix for crash on POSIX platforms occurring when
        any configurable directories (e.g., active, completed, temporary,
        autoload, request) contain other than 7-bit characters, which should
        improve the experience of users using Cyrillic characters (the behavior
        in that case worsened after the previous release because the previous
        fix was incomplete)
      □ Fixed crash when choosing to use an active directory without supplying
        a path to that directory (seen when users attempt to specify a
        nonexistent directory (possibly by misspelling the desired existing
        directory) for the active directory via the web UI)

20101027 - Revision 22789

Changes

      □ Added fields to the About box in the web UI to present the external IP
        address and UDP/TCP ports assigned by a UPnP router to the server
      □ Added speculative fix for crash on POSIX platforms occurring when any
        configurable directories (e.g., active, completed, temporary, autoload,
        request) contain Unicode characters
      □ Fixed documentation by changing feed_id to feed-id in two places

20101022 - Revision 22708

Changes

      □ Added daemon argument which directs the server to run in its own
        process group
      □ Added usage argument which directs the server to display the set of
        valid command-line arguments before exiting - server also prints error
        and usage messages before exiting if it detects at least one
        unrecognized command-line argument
      □ Added settings finish_cmd and state_cmd to provide a way to invoke
        asynchronous processes for torrent lifecycle events
      □ The add torrent dialog in the web UI now allows the user to choose
        which download directory to use for the torrent being added
      □ Correct JSON output is now generated for the list-dirs action request
      □ The name of the directory created by extracting the product archive now
        includes utorrent instead of bittorrent
      □ Removed ul_slots_per_torrent setting since it no longer has a function
      □ Added ut_webui_dir setting in the configuration file, which specifies
        the directory containing the webui.zip archive or the unarchived files
        to be served for the web UI
      □ Added pidfile argument which permits the specification of a file to be
        created by the utserver process which will contain the ID of the
        utserver process
      □ Added logmask setting in the configuration file which permits logging
        to be configured (and subsequently modified as part of handling a
        hangup signal), and removed support for LOGMASK environment variable
      □ The server rereads the configuration file upon receipt of a hangup
        signal or when creating or moving a file named rcf.utmr in the
        dir_request directory - see the cautions in the user manual about
        sending a hangup signal when attempting to change the value of
        dir_request
      □ Added settings admin_name and admin_password to allow administrators to
        define initial non-default credentials for authenticating to the server
        via the HTTP interface
      □ Fixed documentation by changing filter_id to filter-id in one place

20100913 - Revision 21886

Changes

      □ Ensure alternative listening port setting persists when changed via web
        UI
      □ Include changes list in docs directory of product archive
      □ Add mention of configfile and settingspath command-line arguments,
        rearrange content of Getting Started section of user manual
      □ Support configfile argument to specify configuration file location
      □ Disable BEP22 DNS support on POSIX platforms
      □ Include plain text version of the user manual in docs directory of
        product archive
      □ Include a EULA file in the docs directory of the archive
      □ Change default log file for logfile argument to utserver.log
      □ Fix documentation error saying to use forward slash (/) to precede a
        command-line argument keyword - should use a dash (-) on POSIX systems
